{-
1 Problem 1
(*) Find the last element of a list.

(Note that the Lisp transcription of this problem is incorrect.)

Example in Haskell:

Prelude> myLast [1,2,3,4]
4
Prelude> myLast ['x','y','z']
'z'
-}


lastElement :: [a] -> a
lastElement (x:[]) = x
lastElement (x:xs) = lastElement xs

lastElement2 :: [a] -> Maybe a
lastElement2 [] = Nothing
lastElement2 xs = Just (head . reverse $ xs)

lastElement3 :: [a] -> a
lastElement3 xs = last xs


{-
(*) Find the last but one element of a list.

(Note that the Lisp transcription of this problem is incorrect.)

Example in Haskell:

Prelude> myButLast [1,2,3,4]
3
Prelude> myButLast ['a'..'z']
'y'
-}

butLast :: [a] -> Maybe a
butLast (x:[]) = Nothing
butLast xs = lastElement2 . init $ xs



{-
(*) Find the K'th element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.

Example:

* (element-at '(a b c d e) 3)
c
Example in Haskell:

Prelude> elementAt [1,2,3] 2
2
Prelude> elementAt "haskell" 5
'e'
-}

elementAt :: [a] -> Int -> Maybe a
elementAt xs at
		| at > ( length xs ) = Nothing
		| at < 1         = Nothing
		| at == 1        = Just . head $ xs
		| otherwise      = elementAt (tail xs) (at - 1)


{-
(*) Find the number of elements of a list.

Example in Haskell:

Prelude> myLength [123, 456, 789]
3
Prelude> myLength "Hello, world!"
13
Solutions
-}

myLength ::[a] -> Int
myLength [] = 0
myLength xs = 1 + (myLength . tail $ xs)



{-
(*) Reverse a list.

Example in Haskell:

Prelude> myReverse "A man, a plan, a canal, panama!"
"!amanap ,lanac a ,nalp a ,nam A"
Prelude> myReverse [1,2,3,4]
[4,3,2,1]
-}

myReverse :: [a] -> [a]
myReverse [] = []
myReverse (x:xs) = myReverse xs ++ [x]


{-
(*) Find out whether a list is a palindrome. A palindrome can be read forward or backward; e.g. (x a m a x).

Example in Haskell:

*Main> isPalindrome [1,2,3]
False
*Main> isPalindrome "madamimadam"
True
*Main> isPalindrome [1,2,4,8,16,8,4,2,1]
True
-}


{-
(**) Flatten a nested list structure.

Transform a list, possibly holding lists as elements into a `flat' list by replacing each list with its elements (recursively).

Example:

* (my-flatten '(a (b (c d) e)))
(A B C D E)
Example in Haskell:

We have to define a new data type, because lists in Haskell are homogeneous.

 data NestedList a = Elem a | List [NestedList a]
*Main> flatten (Elem 5)
[5]
*Main> flatten (List [Elem 1, List [Elem 2, List [Elem 3, Elem 4], Elem 5]])
[1,2,3,4,5]
*Main> flatten (List [])
[]
-}


{-
8 Problem 8
(**) Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.

If a list contains repeated elements they should be replaced with a single copy of the element. The order of the elements should not be changed.

Example:

* (compress '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
(A B C A D E)
Example in Haskell:

> compress "aaaabccaadeeee"
"abcade"
-}


{-
(**) Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists. If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed in separate sublists.

Example:

* (pack '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
((A A A A) (B) (C C) (A A) (D) (E E E E))
Example in Haskell:

*Main> pack ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'a', 
             'a', 'd', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e']
["aaaa","b","cc","aa","d","eeee"]
-}


{-
(*) Run-length encoding of a list. Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.

Example:

* (encode '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
((4 A) (1 B) (2 C) (2 A) (1 D)(4 E))
Example in Haskell:

encode "aaaabccaadeeee"
[(4,'a'),(1,'b'),(2,'c'),(2,'a'),(1,'d'),(4,'e')]
